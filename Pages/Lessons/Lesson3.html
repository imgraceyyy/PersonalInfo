        <p>Introduction: Introduction to Computer Systems</p>

                <p>
                    A computer system is designed to accept data (input), process it using technology, and produce meaningful results (output). 
                    It is used in almost every industry today, making it important for students to understand its basic principles and concepts. 
                    This topic serves as an introduction for beginners and a refresher for students already familiar with computers.
                    <br><br>
                    Understanding computer systems helps explain how technology works and why computers are essential tools in the modern digital world.

        <p>History: Early Computing Devices and the History of Computers</p>

                <p>
                    Before modern computers existed, people used early computing tools to perform calculations and measurements. 
                    One of the earliest tools is the <b>abacus</b>, which was used as early as the Mesopotamian period for basic arithmetic operations. 
                    It does not require electricity and is still used today, even by visually impaired users.
                    <br><br>
                    Another early tool is the <b>astrolabe</b>, developed during the Hellenistic civilization. 
                    It was used to measure the position of celestial bodies, determine latitude, and measure time.
                    <br><br>
                    The <b>Analytical Engine</b>, designed by <b>Charles Babbage</b>, is considered the first computer. 
                    It introduced key components such as memory, processor, input, and output devices. Later, the <b>ENIAC</b>, built in 1943, became the first electronic computer and was used to compute artillery range tables.
                    <br><br>
                    Many individuals contributed to modern computing, including <b>Alan Turing</b>, <b>Grace Hopper</b>, <b>Steve Jobs</b>, <b>Bill Gates</b>, and <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>. 
                    Their innovations laid the foundation for today's computer systems.

        <p>Types: Types of Computers</p>

                <p>
                    Modern digital computers are classified based on size and capability.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Microcomputers</b> are small-scale computers designed for personal use. 
                    These include desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and smart wearables.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Mainframe computers</b> are large systems used by organizations such as banks, government agencies, and insurance companies. 
                    They can handle massive data and support thousands of users at the same time.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Supercomputers</b> are designed for extremely complex tasks like weather forecasting, scientific simulations, and advanced research. 
                    They use thousands of processors and occupy large spaces.

        <p>Components: Components of a Computer System</p>

                <p>
                    A computer system consists of hardware and software working together to process data.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hardware</b> - refers to the physical parts of a computer that can be touched. 
                    <br><br>
                    These include:
                </p>

                <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Input devices - accept data and instructions from users</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Processing devices (CPU) - act as the brain of the computer</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Output devices - present results to users in readable form</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <p>
                    The <b>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</b> performs all processing tasks and is made up of:
                </p>

                <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Memory Unit</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Control Unit (CU)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <p>
                    The CPU follows a machine cycle: Fetch, Decode, Execute, and Store.

        <p>System Tools: Memory, Software, and the Digital Era</p>

        <p><b>Memory and Data Processing </b>
                    <br><br>
                    Memory stores data and instructions needed by the computer.
                </p>

                <br>

                <ul>
                    <b>Primary Memory</b>
                    <li>RAM - fast but volatile</li>
                    <li>ROM - slower but non-volatile</li>
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Secondary Memory</b>
                    <li>Storage devices like hard disk drives</li>
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Cache Memory</b>
                    <li>Stores frequently used data for faster access</li>
                    <br><br>

                    Data inside the computer is represented using binary digits (bits):
                    <li>0 means Off or False</li>
                    <li>1 means On or True</li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <p>
                    <b>Software and System Operations</b>
                    <br>
                    Software refers to the intangible part of a computer system. It includes programs and applications that instruct the computer what to do.
                    <br><br>
                    There are two main types:
                </p>
                <br>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>System Software</b> - operating systems, device drivers, firmware, utilities</li>
                    <li><b>Application Software</b> - programs used for specific tasks</li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                <p> 
                    Software allows hardware to function properly and helps users perform different activities efficiently.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    <b>Evolution of Computing and the Digital Era</b><br>
                    Modern society is now in the Digital Era, where information is shared through electronic and digital means. 
                    Electronic media includes videos, audio recordings, online content, smartphones, and gaming devices.
                    <br><br>
                    The Internet connects computer systems worldwide through TCP/IP protocols. It enables access to online services such as websites, email, cloud storage, social media, online shopping, and even blockchain-based games like CryptoKitties and Axie Infinity.
                    The evolution of computing continues to influence communication, education, business, and entertainment.
