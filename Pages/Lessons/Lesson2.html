        <p>Overview: Overview of Computing and Science</p>

            <p>
                Computing involves the use of technology where input is processed to produce a desired output. This process can be applied to almost any industry today. Science, on the other hand, is a system of knowledge that focuses on understanding the physical world through observation and experimentation..
                <br><br>
                Computing is considered a science itself because it follows structured processes and operations. When computing is combined with other sciences, it allows the development of more advanced software and tools used in research and industry. Understanding the connection between computing and science helps in creating solutions to problems across different fields.

        <p>Theory: Foundations of Computer Science</p>
        
            <p>
                Computer Science is a branch of science that deals with the study of computation and the design of computers. 
                It focuses on how computers solve problems and how programs are created to make machines perform specific tasks.
                <br><br>
                One important area of Computer Science is the Theory of Computation. 
                This theory explains how problems are solved using algorithms and models of computation. 
                It also studies the limits of what computers can and cannot do. Automata theory, which is part of this field, helps in the development of technologies such as artificial intelligence.

                Another key idea in Computer Science is the Three Great Insights:
