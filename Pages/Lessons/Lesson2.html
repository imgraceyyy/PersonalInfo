        <p>Overview: Overview of Computing and Science</p>

                <p>
                    Computing involves the use of technology where input is processed to produce a desired output. 
                    This process can be applied to almost any industry today. 
                    Science, on the other hand, is a system of knowledge that focuses on understanding the physical world through observation and experimentation.
                    <br><br>
                    Computing is considered a science itself because it follows structured processes and operations. 
                    When computing is combined with other sciences, it allows the development of more advanced software and tools used in research and industry. 
                    Understanding the connection between computing and science helps in creating solutions to problems across different fields.

        <p>Formal Science: Computing and Formal Science</p>

                <p>
                    Computing is classified as a formal science because it uses mathematically defined logic systems to produce results. 
                    Formal sciences focus on abstract systems such as numbers, symbols, and logical reasoning.
                    <br><br>
                    Examples of formal sciences include mathematics, logic, computer science, statistics, cryptography, information technology, and robotics. 
                    These fields rely on concepts like assigning values, determining true or false statements, and using logical rules. 
                    Mathematics and logic are among the oldest forms of science and serve as the foundation of computing.
                    <br><br>
                    With the advancement of computer technology, formal sciences have greatly benefited. 
                    Calculators help in mathematical computation, spreadsheet software supports statistical analysis through formulas and graphs, and robotics and artificial intelligence combine logic and mathematics to support research. 
                    Virtual environments also allow testing and experimenting with ideas related to logic and mathematics.

        <p>Natural Science: Computing and Natural Science</p>

                <p>
                    Natural science focuses on understanding and predicting natural phenomena through observation and experimentation. 
                    Examples of natural sciences include biology, chemistry, physics, astronomy, environmental science, ecology, biochemistry, and earth science.
                    <br><br>
                    Natural sciences depend on quantifiable data obtained through research and experiments. 
                    Accuracy, validity, and peer review are important in ensuring reliable results. 
                    Fields such as biology and astronomy are some of the oldest natural sciences and continue to evolve with the help of computing.
                    <br><br>
                    The computing industry has contributed significantly to natural sciences. 
                    Electron microscopes are used in biology to examine objects not visible to ordinary microscopes. 
                    CT scans provide detailed x-ray images of internal organs. 
                    Gamma ray telescopes mounted on satellites allow scientists to observe distant celestial objects. 
                    Digital sensors also help monitor ocean movements and environmental changes.

        <p>Social Science: Computing and Social Science</p>
                <p>
                    Social science studies society and the relationships between people. 
                    Examples include anthropology, archaeology, education, geography, psychology, and sociology. 
                    Unlike natural sciences, social sciences use both quantitative and qualitative research, with greater emphasis on qualitative data.
                    <br><br>
                    Social sciences help explain human behavior, social structures, and historical development. 
                    Anthropology and archaeology, for example, provide insight into how science and society have evolved over time.
                    <br><br>
                    Computing has improved research and communication in social sciences. 
                    Online forms are used for polls and census activities. Educational websites support learning, while the internet connects people across different locations. 
                    Social networking platforms make it easier to observe social trends, and tools like laptops and projectors enhance teaching and presentations.
