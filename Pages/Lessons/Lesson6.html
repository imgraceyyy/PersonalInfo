        <p><b>Traditional Media and Electronic Media</b></p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    <b>Traditional Media</b> refers to communication and advertising methods that have been used for many years. 
                    These include television commercials, radio advertisements, flyers, newspapers, billboards, and door-to-door sales. 
                    For a long time, these methods were the main way businesses and people shared information. However, their use has slowly decreased as technology has improved.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    <b>Electronic Media</b> uses digital devices and the internet to share information. 
                    People can now listen to music, watch movies, and read content online using computers and mobile phones. 
                    Examples of electronic media include video recordings, audio files, multimedia presentations, slide shows, CD-ROMs, and internet materials. 
                    Electronic media allows people to access information anytime and anywhere.

        <p><b>Benefits of Media and the History of Radio</b></p>
                <p>
                    <b>Electronic media</b> has many benefits to society. 
                    It allows people to receive information quickly, communicate easily, and share ideas with others. 
                    It removes distance and time barriers and makes learning, communication, and entertainment more accessible
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    <b>Radio</b> is one of the earliest forms of electronic media. 
                    It started with Samuel Morse, who created Morse Code, and Heinrich Hertz, who proved that radio waves exist. 
                    Guglielmo Marconi developed wireless communication devices. 
                    Radio became an important source of news and information, especially during World War II, when it was used for communication and public updates.

        <p>Legal</p>

        <p><b>Legal, Ethical, and Societal Issues in Technology</b></p>
                <p>Technology brings many advantages, but it also creates problems that affect people and society. 
                    Legal issues involve laws about technology, personal data, and digital content. 
                    Ethical issues deal with what is right or fair when using technology. 
                    Societal issues focus on how technology affects people, culture, and communities.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Some common issues include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Copyright - protects creators' work</li>
                    <li>Plagiarism - using others' work without credit</li>
                    <li>Cyberbullying - using technology to harm others</li>
                    <li>Phishing - tricking people into giving personal information</li>
                    <li>Digital piracy - illegal copying of media</li>
                    <li>Cybersex - sexual activities online</li>
                    <li>Computer addiction - too much use of technology</li>
                    <li>Digital divide - unequal access to technology</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These issues show why technology must be used responsibly.</p>

        <p><b>Cybercrime Law and the Importance of Electronic Media</b></p>
                
                <br>

                <p>
                    <b>The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (R.A. 10175)</b> protects people from online crimes such as illegal access, data interference, identity theft, cybersex, child pornography, and online libel.

                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p>
                   <b>Media</b> is also regulated by government agencies such as the MTRCB and the Optical Media Board to make sure content is appropriate for the public.
                </p>
                
                <br>
                
                <p><b>Electronic media</b> is important because it supports:</p>

                    <li>Information sharing</li>
                    <li>Online learning</li>
