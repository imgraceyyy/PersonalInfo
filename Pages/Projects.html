                Computing refers to any goal-oriented activity that uses computers to process information, solve problems, or support daily tasks.
                Today, computing plays a major role in almost every part of human life such as education, business, communication, entertainment, and even healthcare.
                <br><br>
                The computing industry, on the other hand, focuses on the research, development, production, and use of computer technologies. 
                This includes both hardware and software that help people work more efficiently and stay connected. Fields such as Computer Science, Information Technology, and Entertainment and Multimedia Computing are all part of this industry.

                Computer Science is a branch of science that deals with the study of computation and the design of computers. 
                It focuses on how computers solve problems and how programs are created to make machines perform specific tasks.
                <br><br>
                One important area of Computer Science is the Theory of Computation. 
                This theory explains how problems are solved using algorithms and models of computation. 
                It also studies the limits of what computers can and cannot do. Automata theory, which is part of this field, helps in the development of technologies such as artificial intelligence.

                    Before modern computers existed, people used early computing tools to perform calculations and measurements. 
                    One of the earliest tools is the <b>abacus</b>, which was used as early as the Mesopotamian period for basic arithmetic operations. 
                    It does not require electricity and is still used today, even by visually impaired users.
                    <br><br>
                    Another early tool is the <b>astrolabe</b>, developed during the Hellenistic civilization. 
                    It was used to measure the position of celestial bodies, determine latitude, and measure time.
                    <br><br>
                    The <b>Analytical Engine</b>, designed by <b>Charles Babbage</b>, is considered the first computer. 
                    It introduced key components such as memory, processor, input, and output devices. Later, the <b>ENIAC</b>, built in 1943, became the first electronic computer and was used to compute artillery range tables.
                    <br><br>
                    Many individuals contributed to modern computing, including <b>Alan Turing</b>, <b>Grace Hopper</b>, <b>Steve Jobs</b>, <b>Bill Gates</b>, and <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b>. 
                    Their innovations laid the foundation for today's computer systems.

                    Modern society is now in the Digital Era, where information is shared through electronic and digital means. 
                    Electronic media includes videos, audio recordings, online content, smartphones, and gaming devices.
                    <br><br>
                    The Internet connects computer systems worldwide through TCP/IP protocols. It enables access to online services such as websites, email, cloud storage, social media, online shopping, and even blockchain-based games like CryptoKitties and Axie Infinity.
                    The evolution of computing continues to influence communication, education, business, and entertainment.
